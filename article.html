			<p class="text">Zomboyâ€™s Neon Grave EP was one of the most impressive to be released last year. Now almost a year later, Twitter has been buzzing with the leaked picture of what might be the artist line up for the remix package to the EP.</p>
			<p class="text">Sources exclusive to EDM Sauce who are close to the artist say that this picture is in fact entirely accurate. That being said the only info the artist has announced himself is that the release date in February 10th. So while we would love to say that this is confirmed, we will just have to wait and see if we can be overcome by one of the most impressive remix packages we have ever seen. Until the 10th all we can do is sit and wait patiently and pray to the bass gods. Take a look below.</p>
